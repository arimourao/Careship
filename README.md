# Careship

Test API developed for careship.de with Lumen API Framework. To test it, just clone this repo and set it in a laravel/lumen API compatible environment or you can also use [Homestead Virtual Machine](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/homestead).
Then you can test the API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) passing the url configured for your server and then acess the "withdraw" route. (i.e http://myserver.local/withdraw/250).
